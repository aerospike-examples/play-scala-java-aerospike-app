To-Do App
=========

This To-Do web application is written using **Play Web Framework, Java, Scala and Aerospike.**

The code is easy to follow and substantial enough to be a foundation in learning how to leverage Aerospike's technology along with other technologies and the app may also be used as a "seed" application that you can expand.

### Application Features

  * Create To-Dos
  * Batch Read and Display To-Dos
  * Delete To-Dos

### Aerospike APIs Used

  * connect - For establishing connection to the Aerospike Cluster. This is done once when the app starts. See custom Play plugin* [ASPlugin](https://github.com/aerospike/play-scala-java-aerospike-app/blob/master/ASPlugin.java)
  * get - For single-record Read and Batch Read operations
  * put - For Write operations
  * close - For closing connection to the Aerospike Cluster. This is done once when the app terminates. See custom Play plugin* [ASPlugin](https://github.com/aerospike/play-scala-java-aerospike-app/blob/master/ASPlugin.java)

## Get up and running

### Prerequisite

- [Aerospike Server](http://www.aerospike.com/download/server/latest) â€“ The server should be running and accessible from this app.
- [Typesafe Activator](http://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted) - It is used to build and run the application.

**Note:** [Aerospike Java Client 3.0.30](https://github.com/aerospike/play-scala-java-aerospike-app/tree/master/lib) comes bundled with this app. If you'd like to use the latest version, [click here](http://www.aerospike.com/download/client/java/latest/) to download it.

### Usage

#### Config

In [conf/application.conf](https://github.com/aerospike/play-scala-java-aerospike-app/blob/master/conf/application.conf), update **aerospike.cluster.ip** and **aerospike.cluster.port** under *Aerospike Cluster Configuration* section such that it points to your server running Aerospike Server.

#### Build and Run

To build and run the application, run command **activator run** from application's root folder.

If all is well, open web browser and point it to: [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

You should see:

If you see **Oops! Connection to Aerospike cluster failed! Please check your Aerospike IP and Port settings in application.conf**, please make sure your Aerospike Server is running and available to this app. Also confirm that **aerospike.cluster.ip** and **aerospike.cluster.port** are set correctly as described above in the Config section.
